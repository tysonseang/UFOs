# UFOs

## Overview of Project

This project uses JavaScript, basic HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS to create a dynamic site that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly. 

The dynamic site provides users with data related to UFO sightings from across the United States and Canada. The page includes a site header; the title, summary, and text from a UFO-related article; and a table that holds and displays data from various UFO sightings. Data filters were created to help users refine their searches across multiple criteria at the same time. Filters are provided for the date, the shape of the reported UFO, and location-based data, including the city, state, and country of the events.

## Results
"Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation."




# Summary

While the code modifications that were added allow for more detailed analysis through additional filtering components, there are some drawbacks to this new design. In this project, the filter button was removed. Data is filtered based on user input and executed following a Mouse click outside of the text box or following an Enter/Return keyboard selection, but this might not immediately be clear to the end user. Buttons often serve as a helpful call-to-action for end users, prompting them to enteract with the site in a desired way. I suggest re-adding a Search or Filter button below the various filter input boxes to make the site more user-friendly. Additionally, I would suggest a button color that sharply contrasts from the site's dark gray background.
