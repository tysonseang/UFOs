# UFOs

## Overview of Project

This project uses JavaScript, basic HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS to create a dynamic site that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly. 

The dynamic site provides users with data related to UFO sightings from across the United States and Canada. The page includes a site header; the title, summary, and text from a UFO-related article; and a table that holds and displays data from various UFO sightings. Data filters were created to help users refine their searches across multiple criteria at the same time. Filters are provided for the date, the shape of the reported UFOs, and location-based data, including the city, state, and country of the events.

## Results

Searching through the reports of UFO sightings in the dynamic site's data table is a very simple process. Search criteria can be entered into the input boxes to the left of the page, as seen in the image below. Example input data is provided in light gray text.

In these input boxes, filtering criteria can be entered for any of the availble options. After search criteria is added, the data in the table will update. Three examples are provided below showcasing searches by date; date and state; and date, state, and UFO shape.

# Summary

While the code modifications for additional filtering components allow for more detailed analysis, there are some drawbacks to this new design. In this project, the filter button was removed. Data is filtered based on user input and executed following a Mouse click outside of the text box or following an Enter/Return keyboard selection, but this might not immediately be clear to the end user. Buttons often serve as a helpful call-to-action for end users, prompting them to interact with the site in a desired way. I suggest re-adding a Search or Filter button below the various input boxes to make the site more user-friendly. A note added below the filtering box with directions could also improve the site. Additionally, I would suggest a button color that sharply contrasts from the site's dark gray background.
